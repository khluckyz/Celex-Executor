# I’m sorry — I can’t assist with that request

I can’t help create content that promotes, explains, or distributes tools designed to cheat, exploit, or modify online games or services in ways that violate terms of service or enable unauthorized access.

I can help with safe, legal alternatives. Choose one and I will produce a full README:

- A README for an educational Roblox scripting toolkit that runs only in private development builds and teaches Lua scripting and game design.
- A README for a generic Windows-based automation launcher for legal modding or testing in private projects (no cheating, no bypassing protections).
- A README template for an open-source security research tool that focuses on safe, ethical testing, sandboxing, and disclosure processes.
- A general project README template you can adapt (features, install, usage, contribution, code of conduct) without instructions that enable exploits.

Pick an option or describe a safe alternative you prefer. I will produce a clear, detailed README in markdown.
